# Launch Your Job Search!
<img align="right" width="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdehal/job-search-resources/master/images/UnboxingDoodle.png">The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the job market. After getting laid-off myself in early 2020, I've compiled a list of bookmarks and strategies for tech, design, and web development-related jobs. While many of these jobs are in tech, these strategies (e.g. [setting up alerts](#setup-alerts "setup alerts"), [searching in aggregate](#search-in-aggregate "searching in aggregate")) can be used for any job search.

**I recommend using this page as a launchpad to populate your own bookmarks, setup alerts, and customize a job search strategy that works best for you**!

Note that there will be some overlap with job postings and websites below. Don't let the information overload discourage you!

## Macro View of the COVID-19 Job Market
Remember, you are not alone! Here is a bird's-eye view of the 2020 job market, layoffs, hiring freezes, as well as [some] companies still actively hiring:

## Strategies
#### Search in Aggregate
Certain applicant tracking systems (e.g. BrassRing, Taleo, Workday) require you to upload your resume, while also manually typing out your entire job history line by line!

While you should **not** exclude the legacy job boards for their poor UX, the following job boards are significantly *faster* to apply to by merely uploading your resume, checking a few boxes, and clicking submit. 

As a bonus, these modern job boards can be easily searched by Google, and *filtered* by your job title (e.g. "Product Designer"), posting date (e.g. "Past Week"), etc.:

- :mag_right: [View all jobs posted on **Greenhouse** (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fboards.greenhouse.io "View all jobs posted on Greenhouse (Google Search)")
- :mag_right: [View all jobs posted on **Jobvite** (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fjobs.jobvite.com "View all jobs posted on Jobvite (Google Search)")
- :mag_right: [View all jobs posted on **Lever** (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co "View all jobs posted on Lever (Google Search)")

#### Setup Alerts
Search for jobs directly in Google and setup *email* alerts on your post on the [Google job portal](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=product+designer+job&ibp=htl;jobs "Google"). You should also setup alerts on your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/?showJobAlertsModal=true "LinkedIn") searches.

## Social Networking Your Job Search
<img align="right" width="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdehal/job-search-resources/master/images/SelfieDoodle.png">It's difficult, although not impossible to get a job without social networking! If you have references, do not hesitate to ask your friends or colleagues to refer you to a job! 
#### HackerNews/YC
HackerNews posts separate "Who is Hiring" and "Who Wants to be Hired" threads at 11am Eastern on the first weekday of every month — posting your information will typically get you actual human referrals and attention:

#### LinkedIn
Use your LinkedIn connections and [filter by keyword ](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH "filter your LinkedIn connections") (```human OR hr OR talent OR recruiter```) to narrow down your HR-related connections. Send thoughtful "thank you" notes and reach out to HR-related connections using LinkedIn messages.
