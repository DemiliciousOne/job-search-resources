# Launch Your Job Search!
The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely changed the job market. After getting laid off myself in early 2020, I've compiled a list of bookmarks and "cheats" for tech, design, or web development-related jobs, with an emphasis on North America and/or remote. While many of these jobs are in tech, these strategies (e.g. [setup alerts](#setup-alerts "setup alerts"), [searching in aggregate](#search-in-aggregate "searching in aggregate")) can be used for any job search.

Note that there will be some overlap with job postings and websites below — don't let the information overload discourage you — I recommend using this as a *launchpad* to populate your own bookmarks, setup alerts, and *customize the workflows and processes that work best for you*!

## Macro View of the COVID-19 Job Market :earth_americas:
You're not alone! Here is a birdseye view of the 2020 layoffs, hiring freezes, as well as companies still actively hiring:

## Cheat Modes :running_woman:
#### Setup Alerts
Search for jobs directly in Google and setup *email* alerts on your post on their job portal [Google](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=design+manager+job&ibp=htl;jobs "Google").  You should also setup alerts on your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/?showJobAlertsModal=true "LinkedIn") searches.

#### Search in Aggregate
Certain applicant tracking systems (e.g. BrassRing, Taleo, Workday) have poor UX — asking you to upload your resume while also requiring you to manually type out your entire job history!

While you should **not** exclude the legacy job boards for their poor UX, the following job boards are significantly faster to apply to by merely uploading your resume, checking a few boxes, and clicking submit. 

These modern job boards can be easily searched by Google, and filtered by your job title (e.g. "Design Manager"), posting date (e.g. "Past Week"), etc.:

## Social Networking Your Job Search :speech_balloon:
It's difficult, although not impossible to get a job without social networking! If you have references, do not hesitate to ask your friends or colleagues to refer you to a job! 
#### HackerNews/YCombinator
HackerNews posts separate "Who is Hiring" and "Who Wants to be Hired" threads at 11am Eastern on the first weekday of every month — posting your information will typically get you actual human referrals and attention:

#### LinkedIn
Use your LinkedIn connections and [filter by keyword ](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3B4B38YEBqTo%2BDDjaTUHjcHA%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections-search_with_filters "filter your LinkedIn connections") (```human OR hr OR talent OR recruiter```) to narrow down your HR-related connections:
